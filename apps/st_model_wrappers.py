class SummarizationModel(object):
    """
    Wrapper class for a summarization model for use in the Summarize. Streamlit app.

    This wrapper class is designed to abstract away the complexities of juggling
    multiple different summarization models in the Summarize. Streamlit app.  
    The load and summarize methods should point to functions that will be called during 
    execution of the Summarize. app. These functions are designed to operate independently
    so that loading and summarizing functionality can be cached separately in the 
    Streamlit app. This is also why this class does not store the actual model object, 
    once loaded. 

    name        (str) short, general name for the model
    load        (uncalled) function that loads the model (from HF Model repo, spaCy, etc.).
                This function accepts no arguments and returns the model.

                Example:
                def load_HF_model():
                    return trf.pipeline("summarization") # this loads a full summarization pipeline

    summarize   (uncalled) function that generates a summary from a longer document.
                This function must accept a document (str), and a SummarizationModel object
                and returns a summary (str)

                Example:
                def summary(document, model):
                    # assuming the HF Summarization pipeline is passed as the model
                    return model(document)[0]['summary_text'] 

    display_name    (str) longer/more detailed description for display in the model selection 
                    box of Summarize. 
    description     (str) Description of the model for display under the model selection box 
                    in Summarize.

    (those with many votes) count for even more. \
    \n\n In this classic version, each vertex represents a word from the document. \
    The edges between the vertices (the \"votes\") are the co-occurrence of those words \
    within a given context window size. After the graph is constructed, the PageRank \
    algorithm (of search engine fame) computes the recursive scoring. These scores are \

    The edges of the graph are the cosine similarity between each pair of sentence representations. \
    The PageRank algorithm computes the final importance scores for each sentence. \
    Sentences with the highest scores are selected as the document summary.",

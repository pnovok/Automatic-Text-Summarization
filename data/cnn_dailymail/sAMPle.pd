"Pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months, official safety figures reveal. Twelve of the cases resulted in the pilots requesting a priority landing, one flight was diverted and on two flights the pilots made an emergency Mayday call. Among the worst cases, one incident report in February noted: ‘Fumes in cabin. Eleven of the cabin crew became unwell during flight, with symptoms of light-headedness, nausea and “sea sickness”. Oxygen administered. Aircraft returned.’ Victim? It is suspected British Airways pilot Richard Westgate, who died in 2012, had Aerotoxic Syndrome . The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe for passengers and crew. Details emerged in a report broadcast last night by ITV News, which has seen copies of the Civil Aviation Authority’s safety reports from December 2014 to March 2015. These reveal 167 cases of fumes or smoke in the cabin, not attributable to faulty ovens, coffee brewers or toilets. In February a coroner warned that airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins. Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes. He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012. The 43-year-old, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, had suffered years of persistent headaches, nausea and chronic fatigue, which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits. Mr Payne’s warning came days after the Daily Mail revealed how the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes had sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years. The coroner’s intervention was the first official recognition of Aerotoxic Syndrome, thought to be linked to memory loss, tremors, lethargy, headaches, tinnitus, confusion, breathing difficulties and even death. Safety questions: Pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months. The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe . Warning: Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of those travelling on planes. It followed initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate . Many former pilots, co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have suffered long-term illnesses because of the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and ‘toxic fumes’. The pilots’ union BALPA has raised concerns. Since 1999, the air industry has denied a link between ‘fume events’ and medical problems. But a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous. The problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines. Passengers are usually isolated from this ‘bleed air’ – but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called ‘organophosphates’. In small quantities, these compounds may not be harmful – campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff. The Civil Aviation Authority said several expert studies on cabin air quality have been carried out in recent years. ‘The overall conclusion has been that there is no positive evidence of a link between exposure to contaminants in cabin air and possible long-term health effects – although such a link cannot be excluded,’ it added. ‘Passenger and crew safety is of paramount importance to the CAA and we are constantly working to enhance safety standards.’","Pilots reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in four months .

"Ferrari, who are Ferrari? Lewis Hamilton sauntered to pole position for the Malaysian Grand Prix, nearly one second ahead of Sebastian Vettel’s third-fastest Ferrari. That said, Ferrari are stronger over a long run and may yet provide a threat to Hamilton’s supremacy.

'Come on, guys,' he moaned over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole. Hamilton was relaxed. Vettel was downcast, but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying. Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently, perhaps heeding the advice of Niki Lauda, his team chairman, who told him via Sportsmail to ‘sort himself out’. McLaren will be towards the back of the grid. Jenson Button will start 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the two former champions. A naturally disappointed Button said: 'The car didn't feel bad so it's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there. We've made good improvements this weekend, but qualifying just wasn't for us. 'Hopefully we'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow, but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well.' Sebastian Vettel qualified third but could threaten Hamilton's supremacy with the Ferrari stronger than Mercedes over a long run .

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was seventh quickest ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, with Sauber pair Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th. Pastor Maldonado lines up 11th, missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second, with Daniil Kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his Red Bull.

Fernando Alonso starts 18th in Shanghai and will have the Manor cars of Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi for company at the back of the grid . Toro Rosso rookies Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr start 13th and 14th, with Sergio Perez 15th in a Force India that is off the pace as the team's financial issues means they will not have their new car on the grid until June. From the initial 18-minute session, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg led the list of departees, finishing three tenths of a second behind team -mate Perez. For the first time this season Manor had both cars taking part in qualifying, with both also comfortably finishing within the 107 per cent rule. Will Stevens, forced to sit out qualifying and the races in Australia and Malaysia due to issues, finally enjoyed a one-lap session. The 23-year-old Briton will start 19th, eight tenths of a second ahead of Roberto Merhi, albeit three seconds behind Alonso, underlining that whilst Manor are fighting, they still have a lot of work to do.","Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season with a scintillating lap in Shanghai .

"In a sport so often dominated by egos, the idiom ‘if he was chocolate, he’d eat himself’ could be used on a weekly basis in boxing. And going by the sobriquet ‘Kid Chocolate’, you might expect Peter Quillin to have an appetite to match his ring alias. Instead, the man who will stand in the opposite corner to Limerick’s Andy Lee next weekend comes across as anything but the egotist. Peter Quillin (left) may be nicknamed 'Kid Chocolate' but he shows none of the expected arrogance . At times, the 31-year-old’s verbal patter buzzes with a modesty and philosophical slant which often betrays the expectations of a hard-hitting middleweight, carrying a 71 per-cent knockout rate in his undefeated record. Only once during the course of an exclusive interview with Sporstmail does Quillin speak with a hint of bite to match the aggression that saw him put Hassan N’Dam N’Jikam on the canvas six times en route to his 2012 world-title win. This comes when he is questioned about the criticism he received after opting to vacate his WBO world championship last year. While Lee is the defending champion next weekend, Quillin, the challenger, is also the former title holder having never lost the belt in the ring. The 31-year-old had been due to defend against undefeated Russian Matt Korobov but turned down a career-best $1.4million pay day when deciding not to fight the mandatory challenger. Lee later stepped in to defeat the Russian (for a much lower purse), leaving Quillin to face accusations of ‘ducking’ his obligations as champion. Only recently did Quillin reveal that he took a sabbatical to deal with the conflicting emotions of welcoming his first child into the world, while seeing his uncle unsuccessfully battle cancer. ‘I learned a lot of patience through that, so I couldn’t care less what people’ s opinions are or what they’re about. Nobody gets paid to care!,’ blasted Quillin about the flak he faced for giving up his belt. ‘It’s about being challenged, you’ll be challenged for all different decisions that you make – [decisions] that I made in my life and I think that applies to anybody else. The American has a 71 per cent knockout ratio, but he is keeping his feet on the ground ahead of the fight . ‘I just worry about myself, keep good thoughts and a positive mind and keep a great mindset for myself and that I’m just focused.’ Quillin’s first son, Joaquin, was born last August, at the same time his close uncle, Eric Munson, battled pancreatic cancer, losing his fight just two months ago. He has been out of the ring for 12 months since his last title defence. Has he been able to shake the ring rust and the emotional baggage? ‘Everything is a challenge in life. I was always in the gym, but I was dealing with mental stuff and I’m glad I overcame those things. ‘Now I’m back to where I need to be at,’ answered Quillin. ‘Testament to that is when I step into the ring with Andy Lee on April 11. I challenge myself to overcome these things. ‘My uncle’s in his casket and gone now so I got a closing period, a one on one with my uncle before he passed. ‘I left him in Grand Rapids (Michigan) on February 2 and he passed three days after. It was like a rough thing, but I had my closing period where I accepted that the fate of God is going to be what it is and I didn’t have no control over that. I just learned some powerful things – that I need to accomplish as much as I can while I’m living so that I don’t have regrets when it’s my time. ‘Now I’m just looking forward and Andy Lee is who’s in front of me right now.’ Moving on seems to be a regular feature of Quillin’s life. Next week’s fight with Lee will take place in the challenger’s adopted home town, but to call Quillin one of ‘Brooklyn’s Own’ is to ignore his path. Born in Chicago, but raised in Grand Rapids, only his ‘Kid Chocolate’ nickname hints at his pedigree. Quillin, who will fight Andy Lee next week, says it will be a big test against the Irish fighter . He was christened with the alias owing to his physical resemblance to the legendary Cuban featherweight champion of the same ring name, but Quillin also has a blood connection to the Caribbean island as his father was born there before defecting to the US. ‘I went there in 2009 and spent two-and-a-half weeks there and it was one of the best times. I got to learn about life and experience, something different other than what I’m used to,’ says Quillin on his pilgrimage to Cuba. ‘Living in the United States all your life, you go out to another country and you assume you know everything until you see other people living a certain way. ‘I had to recheck myself and say I’m not somebody that knows everything … I found out that it’s not really about the money, it’s about your family. ‘My father left Cuba and met my mom in Chicago – my mom’s an African black lady. My mom spoke nothing but English and my dad spoke nothing but Spanish, but my dad learned English from my mom and my mom learned Spanish from my father. ‘My father knew the original Kid Chocolate in Cuba, but he’s no relation. It’s part of my destiny that I was named Kid Chocolate by other people. Quillin has been away from the ring for a while, but is now ready to recapture his title against Lee . ‘I knew I had a big responsibility when it came to taking on the name. It’s a great part of my story to inherit a name like that and fight for the legacy of a fellow Cuban.’ Undefeated in 31 fights with 22 knockouts, Quillin is doing his best to uphold that honour but critics have suggested that he has not always taken on the best opponent available. He has defeated some big names, including an old Ronald ‘Winky’ Wright, while his stoppage wins over tough contenders were impressive and his title win over N’Dam (Lee’s opponent at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games) proved his world-class ability. But Lee is arguably his most testing opponent to date. Quillin is reluctant to compare their respective levels of opposition, however. ‘Andy Lee is just going to be one of those tests for me to go out and challenge [myself]. ‘For me to criticise other people’s performances, that’s not what I came in the game for, I came in the game to be a fighter and worry about fighting. ‘I gave Andy nothing but respect for accomplishing what a lot of people didn’t get to do, which is become a champion so I look at him like a champion and a guy that has never took a loss. ‘You got to realise that Andy is who he is now and Andy today might be different from the Andy that was [around] yesterday or in the future, you never know. ‘We just prepare and train hard to make sure we’re able to learn [about] people right there in that ring and focus on that. ‘You just have to accept sometimes that people try to be great like other people and never become great, but if you’re able to take what you already have and work with those things you become great.’ His words read as a tasty recipe to become a champion.","American boxer out to take back his title from Limerick fighter .

"Egypt's former president Mohammed Morsi has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012. But a court in the country's capital Cairo acquitted the 63-year-old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty. Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges, with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi (pictured at an court appearance in December) has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012 . But the court cleared the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo. Defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, came to power following the 2011 ouster of  Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising. But after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail. Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected. 'This is a surprise... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder,' Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes, told AFP. Buses were set ablaze during 2012 clashes between opponents and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . 'But the sentences are not bad. We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different,' he said. A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years. Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called 'unprecedented in recent history'. Earlier this month, a Cairo court  confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence. The Brotherhood had called for protests in support of Morsi on Tuesday. 'The coup commander is exploiting the judiciary,' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict, referring to Sisi. It said the president was using the courts 'as a weapon in the battle against the popular will and the democratic and revolutionary legitimacy represented by President Mohamed Morsi.' Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers. Verdicts in those two cases are due on May 16. Sisi has vowed to 'eradicate' the Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's presidential election victory in May 2012. Supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood clashed during 2012 street battles in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . The authorities designated it a 'terrorist group' in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms. The crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups, who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces. Officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since Morsi was overthrown. Sisi was elected president in May last year, but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by Mubarak's ouster of a civilian democracy. Sisi's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth. But Sisi has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. In November, a court dropped murder charges against Mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011.","A court in Cairo has sentenced the former leader over abuses of protesters .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)It is a strangely detached scene for the close of America's longest war: military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar, high security bases, on Black Hawks, miles from the front line. But it is how Washington wants this to be. And even though the departure of American troops will be fractionally slower, they will all be inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year, making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire. We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist . Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we're told they've been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It's quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory . And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren't thriving, ISIS are waiting in the wings to fill the gap. With the clock ticking in the background, U.S. officer Colonel JB Vowell remains upbeat: ""It's going to be a challenge, to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance, supplies, resupply. I'm optimistic though; much of this didn't exist in November."" On the outskirts of the base are the relics of the U.S.'s military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill Afghan security forces at an accelerated  rate. SUVs, even old American Humvees -- now gifted to Afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes. The Americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here, assess their resupply needs, or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts. Throughout, the surreal changes in how this war was, and continues to be, fought are omnipresent. Years ago, the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an American base. Now we are far from the threat, but another has taken its place. Surrounding our crew at all times are ""Guardian Angels"" -- U.S. soldiers on guard duty, protecting their own from rogue Afghan police or soldiers, trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- ""green on blue"" attacks, in which Afghan security forces turn their guns on Americans. It is a strange experience to be protected from those who America seeks to hand the country over to. But this is how the war ended. Not with ideological victories, or dramatic withdrawals, just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side.","Final troop pullout oddly detached as U.S. military operations die down in Afghanistan .

The binmen in Farnham, Surrey, said the bag of Walkers prawn cocktail crisps fell foul of the rules – even though it had been dropped there by a litterbug and not by the owner of the bin (file image) Now enraged residents in Farnham, Surrey, have branded waste collection squads as 'little Hitlers' for enforcing recycling rules to the letter. Homeowners have been told to remove any non-recyclable material from the wheelie bin lids. Dozens of people have now taken to social media to complain that their blue wheelie bins have been left full ofwaste by the collection teams which are  'trying to make a point' over recycling rules. Tracy Porter said on Facebook 'I am so angry about this. 'I live opposite a shop and some kind person, not wanting to litter the area, put their crisp packet in the top of my recycling bin, and for that I have to be penalised. 'They would not empty the bin. It's not my fault, not even my rubbish. What is the place coming to?' Another resident, Peter Smith, said he had been left with a wheelie bin full of rotting waste after the collection team refused to empty it because they saw a piece of cellophane paper. They ruled the cellophane was not recyclable and broke the rules, but Mr Smith said 'Why not take that little bit off and take the rest? 'They are behaving like little Hitlers.' Waverley Council defended the binmen, saying they had 'nowhere suitable' to put non-recyclable items. The council has suggested placing overflowing recyclable waste in cardboard boxes alongside the blue wheelie bins. Enraged residents in Farnham, Surrey, have branded waste collection squads as 'little Hitlers' for enforcing recycling rules to the letter . But resident Teresa Johnstone responded 'We live in England - will they bother to pick up rain-sodden boxes which have disintegrated when they can't even lift a crisp packet from the bin in the first place? I very much doubt it.' A council spokesman said 'To prevent a whole truck of materials ending up in landfill, undoing the good work of a majority of residents who are recycling correctly, the council enforces the non-collection of contaminated recycling bins. 'All collectors working for Waverley's contractor have stickers to place on bins which detail why it has not been collected and remind residents what should and should not be in the blue bin.' The online discussion was not completely one-sided, with some residents posting messages of support for the council's stance and questioning some people's commitment to recycling.

"Neuroscientists have succeeded in creating 'ghosts' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected 'presence' in the room. The spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it's only our mind playing tricks. The invisible, creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed-up signals in the brain, the researchers say. Scroll down for video . The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain. 'This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain,' said Professor Olaf Blanke of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland . Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. The sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers. Under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self-perception, but lead researcher Olaf Blanke explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body. 'Most of the research predicts that we cannot tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand, of my hand, touching my body or touching one or another position. However, if this is not fully integrated because I'm doing it or if I cannot correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me; in those cases of uncertainty, very often in those cases of double touch, the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else,' said Blanke who is leading the research at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL). The findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence, even a guardian angel, demon or apparition stalking their movements. These are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations, such as mountaineers and explorers, or those grieving for a lost loved one. They are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain, including epilepsy, migraine, schizophrenia and cancer. Blanke's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body, in other words a ghost sensation. MRI scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self-awareness, movement and the sense of position in space. These brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing, important for the perception of one's own body. The scientists then conducted an experiment to 'trigger' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects. Blindfolded and wearing ear-plugs, test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device. Behind them, the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back. When conducted in real time, the participant's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement. However, when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling. 'We built a robot which allows us to distort this signal, which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals. Artificial 'ghosts' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop. By having signals mixed up in their brains (shown), volunteers were made to feel that a creepy 'presence' was behind them. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing . 'And one side effect of this was, instead of saying that I'm touching myself or that I'm touching with my index finger my own body; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them. 'And this somebody else; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them, but somebody else was also present. 'So strong, that some of them decided not to finish the experiment,' said Blanke. The robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting, mixing up 'sensorimotor' brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body. Blanke said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances. The study, published in Current Biology, said that 'simple sensorimotor conflicts induced, in healthy subjects, an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive, first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia'. Blanke says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. He hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that doesn't induce neurological symptoms, but helps patients overcome such sensations. 'We are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients.' Here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment. The robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent 'ghost'. The study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, migraine and tumours . Such therapies, he says, could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down-regulate - or reduce - these feelings; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab. 'A more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set-up of the device that you have seen. So this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes; smart textiles in a way. And should there be strong manifestations in this case, one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis-regulate or to down-regulate such a state.' Two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment, the results of which appear in the journal Current Biology.","Swiss researchers carried out an experiment to make artificial 'ghosts'

"Lance Armstrong has said the World Anti-Doping Agency and others are 'owed an apology' from him for cheating during his cycling career - but noted that the agency's chief rebuffed efforts to meet back in 2013. David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.'
